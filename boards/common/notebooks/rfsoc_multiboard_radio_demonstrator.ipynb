You should understand that the RFSoC platform can also transmit RF signals wirelessly. Remember that unlicensed wireless transmission of RF signals may be illegal in your geographical location. Radio signals may also interfere with nearby devices, such as pacemakers and emergency radio equipment. Note that it is also illegal to intercept and decode particular RF signals.
